<h1>Python Assignments</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a series of assignments from CS152 Introduction to Python Programming focused on core programming concepts and creative Turtle graphics implementations.
<br />

<h3>Assignment 1</h3>
This assignment explores object-oriented programming in Python by extending the Turtle class to create a custom StampTurtle with unique forward and backward methods that stamp and change color as they move. It introduces key OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphism through interactive graphics and class-based customization.
<br />

<h3>Assignment 2</h3>
This assignment focuses on refactoring a Turtle graphics program to improve structure and readability by writing and using both non-fruitful and fruitful functions. It demonstrates modular programming by separating drawing logic into reusable functions, calculating geometric values, and adding a custom function to enhance the main program.
<br />

<h3>Assignment 3</h3>
A Python Turtle assignment that uses string slicing and loops to simulate a scrolling marquee. The project focuses on functional decomposition, loop refinement, and dynamic text display with animated motion.
